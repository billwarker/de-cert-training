# Land a job at A24

Shit, they produced/distributed:

- Good Time, Uncut Gems
- Stop Making Sense
- The Lighthouse, The Northman


## 1. Get a job related to data + entertainment/film industry

Optional. Depends on availability and what job market looks like in Toronto, NYC, East Coast

### Ideas

- A24
- TIFF, any film festivals (volunteer work?)
- Warner Brothers, Sony/Netflix/Amazon Studios, anything film production industry
- Online Journalism

### Research

- Wikipedia, Industry News

## 2. Create interesting and insightful DA/DE projects centred around gathering, aggregating, and presenting film industry data (perhaps around A24 specifically). Open source, weekly/monthly reports.

- Box office trends
- Total earnings across a film's release window
- Review Score vs. Budgets vs. Box Office Earnings
- Highest grossing movies of the year (certain genres, production companies, A24)
- Data within movie scripts (e.g. amount of Fucks in Uncut Gems). This seems cliche though
- Actors' careers measured through various metrics
- Coverage during a marketing campaign

### Source Data from

- boxofficemojo.com
- Nielson ratings
- Metacritic, Rotten Tomatoes
- Letterboxd

- Gold Castle Analytics

### Online platforms/socials

- Reddit's /r/dataisbeautiful, /r/a24

## 4. Apply to A24, find ways to get involved, etc.
